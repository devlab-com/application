## **About**

**DevSözlük**, The project I have created is a platform that aims to facilitate communication, knowledge sharing, and question and answer opportunities among software developers. In this project, I have built a structure that allows other software developers to contribute as well. This platform enables software developers to share their ideas, answer questions, and help each other.

## Teechnologies

- **Turbo**: A tool for managing monorepos.
- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Next.js**: A React framework for building server-side rendered and static web applications.
- **TypeScript**: A statically typed superset of JavaScript that provides enhanced code reliability and scalability.
- **Tailwind** CSS: A utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom user interfaces.
- **Storybook**: An open-source tool for building and testing UI components in isolation.
- **Supabase**: An open-source alternative to Firebase that provides a set of tools and services for building scalable backend applications.
- **Yarn**: A package manager that doubles down as project manager.

## Getting Started

To get started with the DevSözlük project, follow these steps:

- Clone the repository: `git clone git@github.com:devsozluk/website.git`
- Navigate to the project root directory: `cd website`
- Install the required packages using yarn: `yarn install`
- Go to the apps/web directory: `cd apps/web`
- Create a copy of the .env.example file and rename it to .env, then update the file with your Supabase API keys.
- Go back to the project root directory: `cd ../..`
- Start the web application: `yarn run dev:web`

This will start the web application using the Next.js framework in the `apps/web` directory, as well as the UI components in the `packages/ui` directory.
